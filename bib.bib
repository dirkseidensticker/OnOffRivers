  abstract = {Fine-grained ``chalky'' pottery containing microscopic sponge spicules is commonly recovered from archaeological sites throughout peninsular Florida, but many questions remain about its composition and origins. It is identified by different names, but most are associated with the St. Johns Type series. While it has been commonly assumed to originate in the St. Johns River drainage for which it is named, the prevalence of pottery with these characteristics in other locations has presented the likelihood of independent production in multiple places. In this study, we conducted LA-ICP-MS and XRD analysis of spiculate pottery from three Woodland period (ca. 1000 BCE to 1000 CE) sites, along with comparative clay samples, in order to characterize the raw materials and determine the geographic scope of production. Our results support the theory that this ware was independently produced across peninsular Florida. We further evaluate the hypothesis that this pottery was made with common wetland muck, through consideration of the material properties of muck constituents. This project emphasizes the importance of an ecosystem framework for understanding the long history of spiculate pottery production and its geographic spread within Florida.},

Although such an approach with the single observer grouping samples has a number of advantages, it is problematic when dealing with large numbers of samples. This paper aims to explore different coding systems and statistical analyses for grouping ceramic thin sections. In the example discussed a number of variables are defined, codified and analysed by correspondence analysis, classical multidimensional scaling, non-metric isotonic multidimensional scaling and Sammon mapping. The group separation is compared between methods and with previous non-automatic grouping of the same material. The results are promising for this approach, which can be adapted for different studies by the redefinition of the variables recorded and analysed.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the first review of biases impacting Pleistocene and Holocene radiocarbon dates from Central Africa. Based on the pooling of the research expertise of the co-authors, twenty-four biases are listed, explained and documented and their impact on any radiocarbon date corpus demonstrated. To achieve this, a new corpus has been created of 1764 radiocarbon and TL assays from 601 archaeological sites published in the literature. Each date has been checked for its context. The irregular dynamics of research in space and time seriously impact the end result of previous analyses aiming to achieve a regional understanding of past demographic fluctuations. While peaks in the number of dates from the late Holocene seem to correspond to a positive demographic trend, it is suggested that the declines identified cannot be of any such use for the time being and that today's picture does not presently support claims of a population ``crash'' at a regional or local level for any time period. The numbers are obscured by overall research deficits identifiable throughout the region. The maps of the dated sites presented offer good evidence of this and illustrate the vast expanses where no archaeological research has yet been carried out. The number of radiocarbon dates in Central Africa is more an indicator of the effort archaeologists have put into understanding a settlement than it is of ancient demographics. Successive waves of incoming people since c. 3500--3000 cal. BP, the two most important ones known since the 1990s, have created a cultural mosaic of coexisting technological groups. The last 40 years of research have revealed the inner complexity of these waves, some of which avoided parts of the region for centuries, thereby creating an irregular cultural mosaic of land use that is outlined by patterning in the radiocarbon dates.},

D. 800) and Savannah (A.D. 800-1500) period pottery from the St. Marys region were investigated through microscopic examination of aplastic constituents together with consideration ofrefired paste color and sherd thickness. Three gross paste categories were recognized: non-spiculateI non-micaceous paste, representing at least two to five possible clay sources; sponge-spiculate paste representing at least four to five clay sources; and micaceous paste, representing at least four clay sources. It is necessary to use a microscope with at least 105 x in order to recognize most of the paste categories. The results show that Deptford and Savannah period pottery can be distinguished in terms of paste as well as surface treatment. The Deptford period samples are characterized by the predominance of nonspiculateI non-micaceous grit and sand paste. The Savannah period samples are characterized by the abundance of spongespiculate and micaceous pastes. Plain and cord-marked Savannah period pottery is further distinguished by the prominence of grog tempering and absence of grit tempering in the plain wares. The results indicate that these data may be useful for predicting the temporal affiliation of St. Marys region pottery assemblages that lack a clear-cut distinction in surface treatment or in the absence of diagnostic decorated types or other datable remains. The paste data are also well suited for studying the pottery in terms of patterns of clay resource use and manufacturing origins.]},

In order to improve the archaeological study in the region we carried out a detailed mineralogical and chemical study of the fragments of ceramic artifacts found in the two ABE sites of CachoeiraPorteira, in the Lower Amazon Region. Their ceramics comprise the following tempers: cauixi, cariap{\'e}, sand, sand +feldspars, crushed ceramic and so on and are composed of quartz, clay equivalent material (mainly burned kaolinite), feldspars, hematite, goethite, maghemite, phosphates, anatase, and minerals of Mn and Ba. Cauixi and cariap{\'e}, siliceous organic compounds, were found too. The mineralogical composition and the morphology of their grains indicate a saprolite (clayey material rich on quartz) derived from fine-grained felsic igneous rocks or sedimentary rocks as source material for ceramic artifacts, where silica-rich components such cauixi, cariap{\'e} and/or sand (feldspar and rock fragments) were intentionally added to them. The high content of (Al,Fe)-phosphates, amorphous to low crystalline, must be product of the contact between the clayey matrix of pottery wall and the hot aqueous solution formed during the daily cooking of animal foods (main source of phosphor). The phosphate crystallization took place during the discharge of the potteries put together with waste of organic material from animal and vegetal origin, and leaving to the formation of the ABE-soil profile.},

These include: 1) null hypothesis significance testing approaches based on Monte-Carlo simulations or mark permutations; 2) non-parametric Bayesian modelling approaches, and 3) the use of more traditional techniques such as correlation, regression, and AIC-based model comparison directly on the summed probability distribution of radiocarbon dates (SPD). While the range of opportunities offered by these solutions is unquestionably appealing, they often do not consider the uncertainty and the biases arising from calibration effects or sampling error. Here we introduce a novel Bayesian approach and               nimbleCarbon               , an R package that offers model fitting and comparison for population growth models based on the temporal frequency data of radiocarbon dates. We evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach on a range of simulated scenarios and illustrate its application on a case study focused on the demographic impact of the introduction of wet-rice farming in prehistoric Japan during the 1st millennium BCE.},

  abstract = {This paper studied Late Iron Age ceramic fragments from Nditam village (Centre Region, Cameroon), the technological features and deduced the type of the raw materials used to produce them by combining different analytical techniques based on X-ray fluorescence, powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, polarized optical microscopy, spectrophotometry and hydric tests. Macroscopic observations suggest the existence of three types of ceramics according to their colour, black, greyish and red, in the two opposite surfaces, outer (or external) and inner (internal). The chemistry indicates that non-calcareous clayey material was used for ceramic production. The correlation between mineralogy, petrography and the geology of the region suggests a local production of ceramics. Moreover, the chemistry of the samples confirms the existence of the three macroscopic groups and suggests the use of local raw materials for their production. From the mineralogical point of view, quartz, feldspar and mica (biotite and muscovite) were identified in all the samples, while kaolinite and amphibole were detected in some of them. The differences in the mineralogy may indicate some variations in the firing temperature, being lower in the ceramics containing kaolinite compared to the other samples. All the samples have similar water absorption behaviour. According to the colours of the ceramics, a prevalence of oxidising firing conditions was present in the kilns. However, partial reducing and short duration firing conditions were also possible. Comparative study with the mineralogy of ethnographic ceramics from southern Cameroon shows some similarities and suggests a continuity in the use of different local clay pits in this region over time.},

  abstract = {Technical processes---or cha{\^i}nes op{\'e}ratoires---are heterogeneous cultural aggregates articulating raw materials, tools, knowledge, representations, and agents. The nature and arrangement of these elements stem from a web of social, historical, and ecological relations that not only delineate a sociohistorical framework within which artisans operate, but also determine how individuals shape and give meaning to their daily engagement in the craft. Pottery cha{\^i}nes op{\'e}ratoires have been the focus of a large body of ethnographical studies in Africa since the beginning of the 20th century, most of them developing within the subfield of ethnoarchaeology. Yet pottery cha{\^i}nes op{\'e}ratoires may also provide crucial information to historians when analyzed through an approach inspired from historical linguistics and tentatively called ``comparative technology.'' Pioneered by Haudricourt, this approach combines two levels of comparison. The first consists in a minute comparison of different cha{\^i}nes op{\'e}ratoires within a given field of activity and geographical area in order to identify similarities and differences in tools, materials, gestures, and the organization of operations. This allows for the identification of specific ``technical traditions''; that is, shared ways of doing that stem from a shared set of knowledge. The second level of comparison implies a mapping of the technical traditions (be it whole cha{\^i}nes op{\'e}ratoires or particular stages or components), with the aim of identifying and characterizing their respective spatial distributions: for example, the effects of aggregation or disintegration, possible boundaries, or interpenetrations.             The relevance of spatial distributions in history-oriented analyses of technical processes is twofold. First, spatial distributions compel us to explore the sociohistorical processes from which they resulted; that is, the set of relations---social, economic, political, and ecological---that determine how artisans interact with each other, share knowledge, use tools and materials, cope with changing situations, or seize new opportunities. Second, spatial distributions may reveal strong and time-enduring connections with various kinds of social identities (e.g., languages, political factionalism, regional affiliation, gender, and ethnicity). When the underlying mechanisms of such connections are appropriately understood, they may be used to formulate hypotheses about past processes, including population movements, the development and evolution of political boundaries, identity negotiations, or socio-economical transformations. Here, cha{\^i}nes op{\'e}ratoires may prove especially reliable for historians since they are less easily and deliberately manipulated than written or oral documents},

Throughout their research history, sponges have been subjects of intense studies in many fields, including paleontology, evolutionary biology, and even bioengineering and pharmacology. The skeletons of sponges are mostly characterized by the presence of mineral elements termed spicules, which structurally support the sponge bodies, though they also minimize the metabolic cost of water exchange and deter predators. The description of the spicules' shape and the skeleton organization represents the fundamental basis of sponge taxonomy and systematics. Here, we provide an illustrated catalogue of sponge spicules, which is based on previous works on sponge spicules, for example, and gathers and updates all terms that are currently used in sponge descriptions. Each spicule type is further illustrated through high quality scanning electron microscope micrographs. It is expected to be a valuable source that will facilitate spicule identification and, in certain cases, also enable sponge classification.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a petrographic study of pre-Hispanic vessels from archaeological sites located in the middle basin of the Paran{\'a} River, a geographical area where this analytical technique still has very limited application in ceramic studies. Within this framework, a first approach to the chronological variability of pottery through the analysis of 58 ceramic thin sections is carried out. The samples correspond to vessels made by complex hunter-gatherer groups between 625 {\textpm} 46 and 1.380 {\textpm} 100 14C years BP. The pottery was recovered from three archaeological sites: Arroyo Arenal 1, Arroyo Largo I, and La Palmera II (Entre Rios Province, northeastern Argentina), which are linked to an archaeological unit locally called Goya-Malabrigo. The results show, among other chronological variations, an increasing trend in the use of grog temper over time. These data allow the expansion of knowledge about the ceramic technology of human groups who occupied the area of the Paran{\'a} River during the Late Holocene.},

This zooarchaeological study addresses whether the presence of spicules of freshwater sponges in this pottery was a conscious choice on behalf of ancient potters. Based on faunal elements detected in the collection of the Vereda III site and information obtained from ethnographic records and archaeological research on the presence of cauixi in pottery, we discuss whetherits presence in the material results from the inclusion of processed freshwater sponges in the clay or if it derives from the exploitation of sedimentary deposits with spicules. As one of the outcomes, this articlepoints to a necessary revision of the archaeological pottery material of the Aratu-Sapuca{\'i} tradition in Minas Gerais where the identification of cauixi and its origin should both be considered.},

  abstract = {In the absence of wood, bone, and other organics, one possible candidate for determining the age of a site is the radiocarbon (14C) dating of pottery. In central Europe during the Early Neolithic, pottery was ubiquitous and contained substantial quantities of organic temper. However, attempts at the direct dating of organic inclusions raises a lot of methodological issues, especially when several sources of carbon contribute to the resulting radiocarbon age. Hence an alternative approach to dating of the early pottery is necessary. Here, we present a novel method of bulk separation of organic content from the grass-tempered pottery from Santovka (Slovakia). The procedure is based on the consecutive application of three inorganic acids, dissolving clay, silica content, and low molecular or mobile fractions to separate organic inclusions added to the pottery matrix during the formation of vessels. Radiocarbon dates obtained with this method are coherent and produce the shortest time span compared to other pretreatment methods presented in this study. The paired dates of grass-tempered pots with the 14C age of lipids extracted from the same pots point to a difference of 400--600 14C yr, however they are in line with the site's chronostratigraphic Bayesian model. Grasstempered pottery from Santovka (Slovakia) is dated to the first half of the 6th millennium cal BC, making it the earliest pottery north of the Danube. It seems feasible that ceramic containers from Santovka were produced by huntergatherers, and pottery predated the arrival of farming in the Carpathian region by a couple of centuries.},

Material and earth sciences are employed here to determine raw material sourcing, selection and processing. The Kongo kingdom, internationally renowned since the late fifteenth century, is one of the most famous precolonial states in Central Africa. Despite the large number of historical studies relying on African and European oral and written chronicles, there are still considerable gaps in our current understanding of this political unit. Here, we provide new insights into pottery production and circulation within the Kongo kingdom. Implementing a multi-analytical approach, namely XRD, TGA, petrographic analysis, XRF, VP-SEM-EDS and ICP-MS, on selected samples, we determined their petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical signatures. Our results allowed us to correlate the archaeological objects to naturally occurring materials and to establish ceramic traditions. We identified production templates, exchange patterns, distribution of high-quality goods and interaction processes through technological knowledge transmission. Our results demonstrate that political centralisation in the Lower Congo region of Central Africa had a direct impact on pottery production and circulation. We expect our study to provide a sound basis for further comparative research to contextualise the region.},

  abstract = {This paper contains the results of petrographic analysis on 22 ceramic fragments from the Bacabal phase of the Monte Castelo shell mound (Rond{\^o}nia), one of the oldest Amazonian potteries dating up to 4,000 years BP. The petrographic analysis confirmed the high frequency of freshwater sponge spicules (cauixi) as a non-plastic, with novel data on the distribution of spicules that allow us to infer the process of ceramic paste preparation and vessel manufacture. The same proportion between clay matrix and sponge spicules was maintained throughout all Bacabal layers, independent of individual variations for each element. This allows us to infer the existence of a pottery recipe maintained throughout the Bacabal occupation of the site. The same type of sponge spicule described in the ceramic paste was identified in clayey sediments surveyed in the region, although at a lower frequency. Thus, the manufacture of Bacabal ceramics could have involved a combination of: selection of spicule-rich clays; and intentionally added sponge spicules. Sponge spicules in the Bacabal pottery represent an exceptional case for research into the development of ceramic technologies supported by the use of these non-plastics, which became popular during the Upper Holocene in the lowlands of South America.},
